/**
 * The tree is a data structure used to maintain the different branches of the
 * SelectiveHistory.
 *
 * Branches can be "stacked" on each other and an execution path can be derived
 * from any stack of branches. The rules to derive this path is explained below.
 *
 * An operation can be cancelled/undone by inserting a new branch below
 * this operation.
 * e.g
 *    Given the branch A    B   C
 *    To undo B, a new branching branch is inserted at operation B.
 *    ```txt
 *    A   B   C   D
 *        >   C'  D'
 *    ```
 *    A new execution path can now be derived. At each operation:
 *    - if there is a lower branch, don't execute it and go to the operation below
 *    - if not, execute it and go to the operation on the right.
 *    The execution path is   A   C'    D'
 *    Operation C and D have been adapted (transformed) in the lower branch
 *    since operation B is not executed in this branch.
