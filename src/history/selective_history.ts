  /**
   * The selective history is a data structure used to register changes/updates of a state.
   * Each change/update is called an "operation".
   * The data structure allows to easily cancel (and redo) any operation individually.
   * An operation can be represented by any data structure. It can be a "command", a "diff", etc.
   * However it must have the following properties:
   * - it can be applied to modify the state
   * - it can be reverted on the state such that it was never executed.
   * - it can be transformed given other operation (Operational Transformation)
   *
   * Since this data structure doesn't know anything about the state nor the structure of
   * operations, the actual work must be performed by external functions given as parameters.
   * @param initialOperationId
   * @param applyOperation a function which can apply an operation to the state
   * @param revertOperation  a function which can revert an operation from the state
   * @param buildEmpty  a function returning an "empty" operation.
   *                    i.e an operation that leaves the state unmodified once applied or reverted
   *                    (used for internal implementation)
   * @param buildTransformation Factory used to build transformations
