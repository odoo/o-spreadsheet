/**
 * Model
 *
 * The Model class is the owner of the state of the Spreadsheet. However, it
 * has more a coordination role: it defers the actual state manipulation work to
 * plugins.
 *
 * At creation, the Model instantiates all necessary plugins.  They each have
 * a private state (for example, the Selection plugin has the current selection).
 *
 * State changes are then performed through commands.  Commands are dispatched
 * to the model, which will then relay them to each plugins (and the history
 * handler). Then, the model will trigger an 'update' event to notify whoever
 * is concerned that the command was applied (if it was not cancelled).
 *
 * Also, the model has an unconventional responsibility: it actually renders the
 * visible viewport on a canvas. This is because each plugins actually manage a
 * specific concern about the content of the spreadsheet, and it is more natural
 * if they are able to read data from their internal state to represent it on the
 * screen.
 *
 * Note that the Model can be used in a standalone way to manipulate
 * programmatically a spreadsheet.
