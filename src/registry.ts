/**
 * Registry
 *
 * The Registry class is basically just a mapping from a string key to an object.
 * It is really not much more than an object. It is however useful for the
 * following reasons:
 *
 * 1. it let us react and execute code when someone add something to the registry
 *   (for example, the FunctionRegistry subclass this for this purpose)
 * 2. it throws an error when the get operation fails
 * 3. it provides a chained API to add items to the registry.
