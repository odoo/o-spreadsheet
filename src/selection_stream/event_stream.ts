/**
 * Stateless sequence of events that can be processed by consumers.
 *
 * There are three kind of consumers:
 * - the main consumer
 * - the default consumer
 * - observer consumers
 *
 * Main consumer
 * -------------
 * Anyone can capture the event stream and become the main consumer.
 * If there is already a main consumer, it is kicked off and it will no longer
 * receive events.
 * The main consumer can release the stream at any moment to stop listening
 * events.
 *
 * Default consumer
 * ----------------
 * When the main consumer releases the stream and until the stream is captured
 * again, all events are transmitted to the default consumer.
 *
 * Observer consumers
 * ------------------
 * Observers permanently receive events.
